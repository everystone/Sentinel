Bugs:
	all packets with zero data is dropped, but they are still counted as part of the inital number of packets to intercept

Todo:
Settings: 
	- Remember last used network adapter
	- Filters
	- Discard all but tcp,udp
	- Discard packets with zero data (syn, ack, etc)

Method to stop listening
Auto-parse data
functionality: Select 4 bytes, float value is correct, click float value, a third textbox should contain all the "right" values.

When finished, and all packets are analysed: option to generate code to read packet.
Or at least a "recipy", like:

4 bytes int32
2 bytes int16
1 byte boolean
4 bytes float
4 bytes float
total: 15 bytes
